# LearnHub
LearnHub is a full-stack web application designed to give students access to organized resources and collaborative tools, making studying and networking easier. 
Inspiration: LearnHub was born out of the realization that while numerous tools exist for productivity and collaboration, there is still a wide gap in solutions tailored explicitly for students. Platforms like Notion, Trello, Google Drive, Slack, and Microsoft Teams are versatile but often cater to a broad audience, leaving specific academic needs uncatered for. LearnHub fills this void by offering features designed to enhance the student experience, facilitating both individual study and collaborative projects.
Target Users: College and high school students.
